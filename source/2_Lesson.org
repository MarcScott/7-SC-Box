* Designing the box

- We're going to use a program called Solidworks to design our box.
- Solidworks is a 3D CAD program
- You'll get lots of experience with Solidworks later on in the year, so for this section of the project, you'll just be creating a couple of the Solidworks parts and assembling them.
** Design It

- Below is the image of the =net= of the box, showing all the dimensions.
- You're going to design the base and
- Download this file and then open it in Solidworks.
** Try It

- In Solidworks you have to ensure all your drawings are *fully defined*.
- This means that the software must know the dimensions of *every* line you draw.
- Quite often the software is able to work out a dimension of a line, from others you have provided.
- Look at the diagrams below and try and calculate the value of the missing dimensions labeled with a /?/. You can add the dimensions to the Portfolio.md.
