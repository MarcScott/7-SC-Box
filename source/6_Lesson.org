- Now that you've finished the project, it's time to reflect on the work.
- You've made just one box. what if we wanted to make 100 of them, or 1000? 
- What could be done to manufacture the boxes faster? 
- Is MDF the best material to use? What could be use instead? Why would that be better? Would there be any negative points to using that?
- What do you like the most about the box? What don't you like?

   - Why is it important to test a product before putting it on sale?
